React is a JavaScript library for building frontend user interfaces, especially for single-page applications (SPAs). It runs in the browser and helps manage the visual and interactive parts of a website.


## Why Isn't React Development as Visual as Eclipse

### Introduction
As someone used to developing in Java and Spring using Eclipse, I was genuinely puzzled when I started learning React:

Why doesn’t React development come with a fully visual IDE like Eclipse? --> First,download node.js and npm will be downloaded at same time! Second even npm was down at same time still need to install.
Why does everything seem to require the command line (CLI) and configuration files?

This blog post is a summary of what I learned as I transitioned from backend Java to frontend React.

### The Core Differences Between React and Java Ecosystems
**Spring Boot is a Full Platform; React is Just a UI Library***

Spring Boot handles everything—MVC, REST APIs, databases, scheduling, security, and more.

React only focuses on the user interface (UI) logic. Everything else—like routing, state management, and API integration—is up to myself.

With React, I decide whether to add tools like React Router, Redux, TailwindCSS, Axios, etc.
