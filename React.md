## Why Isn't React Development as Visual as Eclipse

As someone used to developing in Java and Spring using Eclipse, I was genuinely puzzled when I started learning React:

Why doesn’t React development come with a fully visual IDE like Eclipse? --> First,download node.js and npm will be downloaded at same time! Second even npm was down at same time still need to install.
Why does everything seem to require the command line (CLI) and configuration files?

This blog post is a summary of what I learned as I transitioned from backend Java to frontend React.
